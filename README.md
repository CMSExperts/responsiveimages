# Add multiple images as alternative for an existing file reference

This is a TYPO3 extension that allows an editor to select further files as alternative
for references.

## When do I need this extension?

Imagine you want to have a different crop setting of an image or even completely different images for an image when
outputting the frontend.

The extension adds an additional field to select alternative images and set them with a tag, so it can be reused
in the frontend.

Also, there is a Fluid ViewHelper to use the functionality directly.

## How to install this extension?

You can set this up via composer (composer require cmsexperts/responsiveimages) or via TER (extension name "responsiveimages"),
it runs with TYPO3 v7, v8 and v9.

## License

The extension is licensed under GPL v2+, same as the TYPO3 Core.
